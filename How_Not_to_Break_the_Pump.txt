Try not to run the pump into the end of the drive screw. This could strip the screw. The pump has built in stall detection as a precaution for running the block to the end of the drive screw, but this should not be used as Plan A. I would recommend setting the volume to be dispensed by the pump (pump_vol) to be less than the current volume in the syringe. This way, the pump will automatically stop before it reaches the end. See documentation for pump_vol, pump_querydis, and pump_clearvol for clarification.
